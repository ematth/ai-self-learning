# ai-self-learning
My public resource repo for reviewing. More specifically, my goal is to compile resources I find and build fundamental AI/ML concepts from scratch.

> **I encourage everyone reading this repo to contribute more resources and code!** Together, we can all learn to be better ML engineers ⭐🧑‍🔬👨‍🔬👩‍🔬⭐

<sup>Background: [Evan Matthews](https://ematth.dev) is an (*open to work*) graduate of UIUC with an MS in Computer Science and a BS in Computer Science + Music.
His technical focus is on AI/ML and audio computation, more specifically on generative models for signal data and music applications.</sup>

### Key:
 
- ✅ -> Actively used, verfied as a good source
- ⚠️ -> Not thoroughly reviewed yet
- 👍-> Personally recommended by Evan  

## Playlists:

- ✅👍 Professor Bryce's [Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgPbN3w-ia_PeT1_c5jiLW3RJdR7853b9)

- ⚠️ 3Blue1Brown's [Neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)

- ⚠️ Eddie in Tech's [5 Favorite ML Books for learning Machine Learning](https://youtu.be/emQGlSJpixA?si=2Z3F8tkj0KNPVaqt)

## Channels (for general learning):

- ⚠️ [Artem Kirsanov](https://www.youtube.com/@ArtemKirsanov) -> Neuroscience PhD student discussing combination of computational neuroscience and deep learning

- ✅ [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown) -> Obvious G.O.A.T mathematics/computer science YouTube channel

- ✅ [Alex Ziskind](https://www.youtube.com/@AZisk) -> Discusses state-of-the-art in commercial hardware, software for developers.

- ⚠️ [NetworkChuck](https://www.youtube.com/@NetworkChuck) -> More general CS channel, but good with up-and-coming popular things in CS and ML.

## Books

- ⚠️ [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/) -> As far as this repo is aware, *the premiere* open-source resource for learning Deep Learning. Examples in PyTorch, NumPy/MXnet, JAX, and TensorFlow.
